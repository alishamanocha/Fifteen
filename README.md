This is a tricky puzzle game called Fifteen! This has been written in Python, using tkinter to create a GUI puzzle.

Instructions:
  1. Click "Shuffle" to shuffle the game tiles. The window should look similar to the below (but with a     different configuration).

  2. Once the tiles are shuffled, your goal is to move all of the tiles into chronological order, like this:

  3. You can only move a tile if it is next to the empty space on the board. To move a tile into the empty space, simply click on the tile.
